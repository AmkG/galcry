quidquid latine dictum sit altum viditur

quis custodiet ipsos custodies

ars longa
vita brevis
occasio praeceps
experimentum periculosum
iudicium difficile

non est salvatori salvator
neque defensori dominus
nec pater nec mater
nihil supernum

per aspera ad astra

entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem

sapienti sat

lupus non timet canem latrantem

excusatio non petita accusatio manifesta

exercitus sine duce corpus est sine spiritu

legi intellexi et condemnavi

mobilis in mobili

nanos gigantum humeris insidentes

quod erat demonstrandum
