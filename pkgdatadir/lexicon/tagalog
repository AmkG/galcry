ang buhay sadyang ganyan

habang may buhay

kamukha
noong tayo bata
ang galing mong sumayaw

talaga lang

hindi kayang tanggapin
mawawala akin

ano ito
kinalat niya

angat iba
ang nangingibabaw
sangkatauhan

ang gumawa malalagot
tulong kailangan upang managalog
ako ang sumagip kanino

ano isang kataga

bakit nga ikaw ang nasa aking alaala

ayokong makulit
saan tayo kakain
inaanyayaan nila tayo
maari ngang andito bumagyo
mapagkunwaring pagkakaibigan
